Genshin RL will be much harder than I originally anticipated, but it's possible to the extent I'd need (replacing me).

How I could simplify?
- instead of having a single press of keys like 'a', 'w', 's', 'd' as actions, I could record myself playing some 'building blocks' of rotations
for example, in my neuvillette/nahida/raidenEM/dehya team, I could do the following actions:
    - switch to neuvi -> neuvillette e -> hold LMB -> switch characters
    - switch to neuvi -> neuvillette q -> hold LMB -> switch characters
    - switch to raiden -> raiden e -> switch characters
    - switch to nahida -> click e -> click e -> switch characters
    - switch to dehya -> click e -> switch characters
- focus on doing domains first (create one universal ai for all domains)
some of the dailies, like the weasel hunt are straight-up captchas that require
high-res. literally this game is designed so that its cheaper to hire humans
to play it instead of creating AIs. Much much harder to navigate as an AI then
Axie Infinity for example. I now wonder why Axie didn't fail sooner, as its
complexity was pretty low.

myślę sobie, że z tymi building blockami wyżej, część algorytmu robiącą dmg wokół pobliskich wrogów miałbym w znaczącej części za sobą, ale niestety ciężko byłoby się obyć bez wizualnych informacji (w kontekście general domain bota).
